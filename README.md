# Hangman
This a simple web version of the popular game.
On every load/refresh, a random word is generated for the user to guess.
The user gets 6 tries to guess the word. If all tries are exhausted the on-screen keyboard is disabled and it's game over.
The keyboard is also disabled when the user guesses the word correctly.
